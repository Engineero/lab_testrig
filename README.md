# lab_testrig
Test and control software for running my research burner, collecting data, and running various control algorithms. Written in LabVIEW.

The main file is `test_rig.lvproj`, which opens the whole project in LabVIEW. The main VI to run is currently `OOP_test_main.vi`.

The `Tests/` folder contains some VIs that were used for testing and developing different features. No unit testing is currently implemented.
